          <h1>About me</h1>
          <p>
            I am an embedded hardware designer specializing in PCB design,
            currently working on advanced Battery Management Systems (BMS) and
            motor controllers. My passion lies in transforming IoT ideas into
            reality, developing innovative hardware, and writing firmware for
            ESP32. Proficient in using KiCad and Altium for PCB design, I also
            excel in C programming, Python scripting, and creating comprehensive
            unit tests. My skills extend to documentation using Overleaf and
            meticulous hardware debugging. Driven by a commitment to
            technological innovation, I strive to create efficient, reliable
            systems that solve real-world problems and enhance everyday life.
            Let's turn ideas into reality together!
